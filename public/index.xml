      <description>trying out docopt    In my last post I created a very small command line interface (CLI) using argparse, which is a built in Python module. This time around I&amp;rsquo;m going to use the same code as before but instead of argparse I&amp;rsquo;ll use a third-party module calle docopt.
I got this idea from a great talk called From Python script to Open Source Project by Michał Karzyński. It has a lot of great content about putting together a fully-fledged open source Python project and I recommend watching the whole thing.</description>

What if I made a custom version of aws s3 cp that was simpler and fit the majority of my copy usecases?
Well, here it is in 43 lines (with proper spacing) using argparse:</description>
