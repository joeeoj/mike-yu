## Recipes

[whatsfordinner.recipes](http://whatsfordinner.recipes/)

Based on [Recipes](https://github.com/jeffThompson/Recipes) by [jeffThompson](https://github.com/jeffThompson) and modifications by [kvpsky](https://github.com/kvpsky). It is a static website, hosted by Netlify in my case, with my favorite recipes and some editorial notes. Helpful for last minute dinner planning.
