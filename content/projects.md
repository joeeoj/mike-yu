## lahnman-to-duckdb

https://github.com/joeeoj/lahnman-to-duckdb

A wrapper around the [baseballdatabank](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/baseballdatabank) (aka Lahnman database) to convert the CSV files into a [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) database for faster, local analytics of baseball data. DuckDB is kind of like the OLAP version of SQLite.

Example queries against the database can be found here: [examples.ipynb](https://nbviewer.org/github/joeeoj/lahnman-to-duckdb/blob/main/src/analysis/examples.ipynb)
