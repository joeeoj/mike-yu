# Recipes

[whatsfordinner.recipes](http://whatsfordinner.recipes/)

Based on [Recipes](https://github.com/jeffThompson/Recipes) by [jeffThompson](https://github.com/jeffThompson) and modifications by [kvpsky](https://github.com/kvpsky). It is a static website, hosted by Netlify in my case, with my favorite recipes and some editorial notes. Helpful for last minute dinner planning.

# Python Workout

[https://github.com/joeeoj/python-workout](https://github.com/joeeoj/python-workout)

Daily (mostly) solutions to the 50-ish problems in Reuven Lerner's [Python Workout](https://www.manning.com/books/python-workout) book.

I have an intermediate knowledge of Python but this continues to teach me interesting techniques and has stretched me to get better at writing tests and fully embrace type hints. I've also been able to experiement with git pre-commit hooks and GitHub Actions.

More importantly it has been a good way to learn without getting overloaded by all-the-things-to-learn.
